# Detection-Limits
Code to calculate detection limits for instruments in Bergstrom Biogeochem Lab

The IC detection limit has three files. 
1. The first(Detection Limit.qmd) is a function for calculating detection limits based on the export tempelate labeled HR_IC_etc. Run this function to add it to your environment. 
2. The second (IC_Detectionlimit_Functionintegrated.qmd) is a quarto document that prompts the user to load their own calibration data and run the function. This is the file that should be most often used. 
3. The third (IC_Detectionlimit.qmd) is a quarto document that breaks the code in the function into individual chunks and explains the code and the decisions I made. Should be the more human-friendly version of funciton itself.
